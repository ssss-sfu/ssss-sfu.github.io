## Getting Started Contributing

### Contribute by reporting a bug/suggesting an enhancement

1. Navigate to the [issues](https://github.com/ssss-sfu/ssss-sfu.github.io/issues) page in this repository
2. Add a new item to the `Backlog` board and give it a clear and concise title and description. Include any other information, images, etc. that may be needed.
3. Give it an appropriate label
4. Thank you for your contribution! Before your item is moved to the `Todo` board, the committee will first take a look.

### Contribute as a developer

1. Get access to the repository as a contributor by contacting the website committee on our [our Discord server](https://discord.gg/XZUd7amxPq)
2. Claim a free task from the open issues or suggest a new issue
3. Set up your development environment (terminal instructions):

   a. Clone the repository locally in a folder of your choice

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/ssss-sfu/ssss-sfu.github.io.git
   ```

   b. Change directories into the newly cloned project folder

   ```
   cd ssss-sfu.github.io
   ```

   c. Install node modules

   ```
   npm i
   ```

   d. Create a new branch in this format:

   ```
   [computing ID or GitHub username]/[task-name-concise]
   ```

   e.g. `kiaanc/read-me-update`

   ```
   git checkout -b kiaanc/read-me-update
   ```

   This will create a new branch and check out instantly to that branch. Equivalent with:

   ```
   git branch kiaanc/read-me-update

   ```

   f. Run the server locally

   ```
