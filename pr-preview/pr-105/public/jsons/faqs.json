      "What is the difference between Computer Science and Software Systems?",
    "content":
      "SoSy focuses more on applied, practical programming, while Computing Science focuses more on math and the theory of programming. Computing Science requires more math- and theory-heavy courses than SoSy. Another thing to note here is the structure of the two programs; Computing Science allows for more of a specialization in different areas if you plan your courses correctly, while SoSy is more structured, and doesnâ€™t allow for as much freedom."
